# Audible-Customer-Churn-Deep-Learning-
Finding if the customer will churn. Using Deep Learning Algorithm
The algorithm start with csv file containing raw data of customers of Audible, who had purchased books or Sample. So model predicts that will the customer visit next time and will he/she buy a new book.
Algorithm start with preprocessing the dataset and convert it into .npz file.
Then modelling the algorithm with Deep Learning using callbacks for early stopping to reduce overfitting.
